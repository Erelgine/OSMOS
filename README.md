# OSMOS
## NOTICE of migration to GitLab
The OSMOS has now moved to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Erelgine/OSMOS) because of GitHub being bought by Microsoft. We do not want our code to be used by this business house that is legitimately stolling our liberty with their « operating system » called « Windows 10 » which is the synonym of « data collector »; nor use this Git repository hosting platform with ads; nor being forced to use Microsoft's proprietary software or « open-source » Visual Studio Code (which is **NOT** open-source in reality if you didn't figure out yet). We will **NOT** come back to this Git hosting platform for theses reasons. If you want to see the current progress of The OSMOS/OSMOS development; visit-us at https://gitlab.com/Erelgine/OSMOS/. Every document on this project refering to GitHub terminology and links will be altered to instead use the GitLab terminology and links.
We and I (Alexis BELMONTE) am very sorry for this inconvenience. Don't lose hope; develop your projects and creativity and most of all: don't ever get trapped by the business dooms. Thank you.
